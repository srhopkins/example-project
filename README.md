The following Goal and MVP defined by client.

### Goal - Create application deployment process with-out downtime, using any tools comfortable to candidate.

### MVP
Using at least two running instances (VMs or containers) with sample HTML app build a deployment process automation that can publish the new app version without downtime. The app it-self can be a simple static HTML page displaying its version.

A good solution should be automated and repro-ducible, organized as a repo on Github with all required files, scripts and docs.
